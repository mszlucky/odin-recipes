      <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For The Rest Of The Dish:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>12 oz. fresh wide rice noodles</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 scallions (split in half vertically and cut into 3-inch pieces)</li>
      <li>3 thin slices ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons regular soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>salt and white pepper (to taste)</li>
      <li>4 to 6 ounces fresh mung bean sprouts</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the beef and marinade ingredients and marinate for about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some fresh rice noodles come as large sheets, while others are already
        cut. If you have the sheets, slice the rice noodles so they're about 1
        inch wide. If the noodles are very stiff and stuck together, bring a wok
        full of water to a boil, and add the noodles. Blanch them for 30 seconds
        to loosen. Transfer to an ice bath and drain thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat your wok over high heat until smoking, and add 1 1/2 tablespoons
        oil to coat the wok. Add the beef and sear until browned. As long as
        your wok is hot enough, the meat shouldn't stick. Set aside. Add 1 1/2
        tablespoons more vegetable oil to the wok. Add the ginger to infuse the
        oil with its rich flavor for about 15 seconds. Add the scallions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the noodles evenly in the wok and stir-fry on high for about 15
        seconds. Add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the sesame oil, soy sauces, pinch of sugar and the seared
        beef. Stir-fry, making sure your metal wok spatula scrapes the bottom of
        the wok. Lift the noodles in an upward motion to mix well and coat them
        evenly with the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a bit of salt and white pepper to taste (taste the noodles before
        adding salt). Add the bean sprouts and stir-fry until they are just
        tender. Serve!
      </li>
