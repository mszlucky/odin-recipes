    <ol>
      <li>
        Place noodles in medium heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water; let
        stand about 5 minutes or until just tender, drain. Using kitchen
        scissors, cut noodles into random lengths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, poach shrimp in salted boiling water until they just become
        pink and opaque. Rinse under cold water, then slice in half lengthwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix together noodles, carrot, cucumber, cabbage, fish
        sauce, sugar, and vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble rolls, place a sheet of rice paper in medium bowl of warm
        water until just softened. Lift sheet carefully from water, placing it
        on a tea-towel-covered board. Place some of the vegetable filling
        horizontally in the center of the sheet and top with one mint leaf, one
        basil leaf, 3 shrimp halves, and sesame seeds. Fold edge closest to you
        up and over the filling; roll sheet to enclose filling, folding in sides
        after first complete turn of roll.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat with remaining sheets and filling.</li>
