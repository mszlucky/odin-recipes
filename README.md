First Odin Project

This first project was a perfect way to test out all the current skills I've 
learned. Thank god for the prettier formatter keeping my lines neat. A few 
other things I've learned is that ! for boilerplates is a godsend, using 
different headers to separate sub lists helps keep things organized, and
there must be a faster way to create list elements, it's probably the most 
tedious part of the project.
